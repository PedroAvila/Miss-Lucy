Going forward, when introducing software engineering we will mean the larger
 subject of “software development + engineering,” implicitly understood without
 specifically separating out the two parts. This will be so even if in many cases the
 discussion is moreaboutthedevelopmentaspect, becausetheapproachwetakeis
 chosentofacilitate the other aspect—engineering. Whenwesometimestalkabout
 software development we want to be specific and refer to the work: the activities
 or the practices we use. We will not further try to distinguish these terms, so the
 reader can in many cases see them as synonyms.
